Simulations were carried out to test the performance of RSIDFT framework for exact matching scenario on a database of length $N=10^{12}$ for two different query lengths $M=10^5$ ($\mu = 0.41$) and $M=10^3$ ($\mu = 0.25$). The database was generated as a equiprobable $\{+1,-1\}$ sequence of length $N$. A substring of length $M$ from the generated database is presented as a query. Also the chosen query was repeated at $L=10^6$ randomly chosen locations in the database.

The sample gain, defined as the ratio of $N$ to the number of samples used from the sketch of database, was varied and the probability of RSIDFT framework to miss a match ($P_e$), as defined below, was measured.
\[P_e = \frac{\text{\# of correctly identified locations}}{L} \]   
The plots of $P_e$ vs. sample gain, is presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Simulation Results} for two different query lengths: $M=10^5~(\mu=0.41)$ in Fig~\ref{Fig:Simulation Results}(a) and $M=10^3~(\mu=0.25)$ in Fig~\ref{Fig:Simulation Results}(b). As can be inferred from the plots we achieve a sample gain of 200-300 (depending on the tolerable error probability) for the query length corresponding to  $\mu=0.41$ and a sample gain of $2$-$4$ for $\mu=0.25$. This sample gain results from an average number of samples per branch $f_i \approx 9.25 \times10^7 $ ($\alpha=0.66$) for $\mu=0.41$, and  $f_i \approx 6.94\times10^9 $ ($\alpha=0.82$) for $\mu=0.25$. The trend in the results almost matches with the theoretical findings of $\alpha = 1-\mu$. We also notice a sharp threshold in the sample gain, below which the RSIDFT framework succeeds with very high probability.
