\section{Algorithm Description}


%Introduce the system model by explaining the FFAST (dual problem - IFFT) architecture and then describe the decoding algorithm - peeling (multiple matches case) and Product code approach (only one exact match case).      


Consider the operations involved in the computation of correlation of $X$ and $Y$, $R_{XY}$, as shown below.

\[  R_{XY} = \underset{\text{ \RNum{1} } } {\underbrace{IDFT}} \ \{ \underset{\text{ \RNum{2} } }{\underbrace{DFT\{ X \} } }  \times \ \underset{\text{ \RNum{3} } }{\underbrace{DFT\{ Y \} } }  \}  \]
