\section{Notations}
This table below will introduce the notations we use in this paper.

We denote signals and vectors using the standard vector notation of arrow over the letter, time domain signals using lowercase letters and the frequency domain signals using uppercase letters. For example $\xv = (x[0], x[1], \ldots, x[N] )$ denotes a time domain signal with $i^{\text{th}}$ time component denoted by $x[i]$, and $\Xv= \mathcal{F}_{N}\{\xv\}$ denotes the $N$-point Fourier coefficients of $\xv$. We denote matrices using boldface upper case letters. We denote the set $\{0,1,2\cdots, N-1\}$ by $[N]$. Note that in Table.~\ref{Table:Notations} we suppose the values of $M$ and $L$ to be $N^{\mu}$ and $N^{\lambda}$ respectively but it is not necessary that these parameters have this form. All our results can be extended straight forwardly to any $M$ and $L$ as long as $M=O(N^{\mu})$ and $L=O(N^{\lambda})$.
