We denote signals and vectors using the standard vector notation of arrow over the letter, time domain signals using lowercase letters and the frequency domain signals using uppercase letters. For example $\xv = (x[0], x[1], \ldots, x[N-1] )$ denotes a time domain signal with $i^{\text{th}}$ time component denoted by $x[i]$, and $\Xv= \mathcal{F}_{N}\{\xv\}$ denotes the $N$-point Fourier coefficients of $\xv$. We denote matrices using boldface upper case letters. We denote the set $\{0,1,2\cdots, N-1\}$ by $[N]$.% Note that in Table~\ref{Table:Notations}, we suppose the values of $M$ and $L$ to be $N^{\mu}$ and $N^{\lambda}$, respectively. However, it is not necessary that these parameters assume the given form. All our results can be extended straight forwardly to any $M$ and $L$ as long as $M=O(N^{\mu})$ and $L=O(N^{\lambda})$.
