% Hyperref setup below.  You should be able to get away with using uncommenting just the first line.
%\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% if \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} doesn't work try this.
% \usepackage{hyperref}  % Hidelinks is an option that removes link visiability.  TAMU Thesis Offices prefers to not see the links. But often doesn't work.  
% 
% \hypersetup{
%     colorlinks=true,
%     linkcolor=black,
%     citecolor=black,
%     filecolor=black,
%     urlcolor=black,
% }
%%%%%%%  End of hyperref setup.  One of these two options should work, but my motto with hyperref is when in doubt, comment it out!
%%%%%%%%%  This hopefully fixes the problem with vertical spacing of section headings at the top of the page..  Commented out in 1.0.7
% \preto\section{%
% \ifnum\value{section}>0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
% }
% \preto\subsection{%
% \ifnum\value{subsection}=0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
% \ifnum\value{subsection}>0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
% }
