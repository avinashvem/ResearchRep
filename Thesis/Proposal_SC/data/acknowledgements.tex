\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.


\indent This section is also optional, limited to four pages. It must follow the Dedication Page (or Abstract, if no Dedication). If listing preliminary pages in Table of Contents, include Acknowledgments. Heading (\MakeUppercase{Acknowledgments}) is bold if major headings are bold. It should be in same type size and style as text. So does vertical spacing, paragraph style, and margins. Also, ensure that the spelling of ``acknowledgments'' matches throughout the text and the table of contents.

I would like to thank the Texas A\&M University Office of Graduate and Professional Studies to allow me to construct this \LaTeX\ thesis template. Special thanks to JaeCee Crawford, Amy Motquin, Ashley Schmitt, Rachel Krolczyk, and Roberta Caton for carefully reviewing this material.  % use A\&M instead of A$\&$M, not use $A\&M$ as well, the last one won't be bold.
