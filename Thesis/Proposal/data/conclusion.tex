In this thesis we provide solutions to some problems in massive multiple access and sparse signal recovery using tools from coding theory. However we believe that there are a wide variety of applications with huge potential in applying these coding theory tools. Below, we list some of the questions that arise emanate from this thesis that need to be pursued and also a few potential applications of the solution designs discussed in this thesis.

\begin{itemize}
\item Study on T-disjunctive codes and T-sparse CS scheme with only 1's
\item LP optimization to find better distributions for random access strategy
\item AWGN channel capacity with appropriate shaping on proposed SCLDPC lattices. This takes care of our gap to Shannon capacity problem
\item CS and GT: numerical and theoretical comparison with other competitive and popular schemes
\end{itemize}
